 # Ipark 
 This my Flutter  project app at mundipolis 2021/2022


Almost every driver knows how difficult sometimes to find a place where you can park your car to do personal things. More than 10 minutes may be lost on such searches every time. In addition, we need to always ensure that our parking time doesn't end and, if necessary, extend it. The main goal for me was to develop a service that will help drivers make searching available spaces faster and simplify the process of paying for their parking time. with I park we solve that problem by letting you park while at home from your smartphone  and also we think of you and we made the possibility to pay from your smartphone.
